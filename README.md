# 7-10-6.icu
## Introduction
To complain about studying stress and pressure in China's middle school, I created this repository.
It is just a way for me to get less stressed, don't take it seriously in the way of \"996.icu\".
I wish to resist the amount of homework, hoping as many as possible people to see it.
~~As a student, I can't update very quickly.~~
## What is 7-10-6?
Just like so-called \"996\", 7-10-6 means studying from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., from Monday to Saturday.
## What the repository is?
This repository is a school-managing emulator. You can add some useful features to it.

I wish more and more China's high school students can join us.
